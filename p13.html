        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Screeech. A hidden door, tucked neatly behind the bar on east avenue, slid open. All eyes turned on the girl standing stiffly at the entrance. 
        <br><br>
        “Finally, Ten! What did you get us this time?” 
        <br><br>
        Ten is the newest member of the club. Though initially skeptical of her naked, spiritless eyes and rather out-dated mask – the Fox series went out of season last year – the girls quickly accepted her once they realized what a convenient job she has. When she’d pulled out not one, but the whole collection of INK & BLOOD – only the newest luxury-edition, advertised to be padded and breathable, masks so popular even those snooty socialites had trouble stocking up on – Six had nearly fainted. Then proceeded to press a very loud, very red lipsticked kiss on Ten’s cheeks. 
        <br><br>
        “Skies above, Ten-jie, you have all that and you still wear that decrepit mask of yours? Does it have sentimental value or something? Did your runaway lover give it to you as your engagement gift?” 
        <br><br>
        Six now chattered nonstop, kneeling before Ten’s suitcase. It opened under Six’s eager fingers, revealing tidy compartments full of HP’s newest products, the features of each mask so lifelike they look as though they had just been jostling each other for space in the crowded suitcase. She brushed a trembling finger over the transparent padding encasing the nearest mask, laced through with jade and onyx tones, with almost reverence on her face. 
        <br><br>
        “How– Ten-jie! This is crazy! This is– this is twice the number you said you’d bring!” The other girls, hearing the fuss, flocked around Six and Ten. 
        <br><br>
        If she has to be honest, it’s really thanks to Ten’s rarely-used employee discount and the generous deposits the girls were willing to pay that this very suitcase holds more than twice-fold the merchandise it should have. But she only blushed and waved away the comment. 
        <br><br>
        Thirteen gasped, the perfect “o” of her mouth telling Ten that this was a practiced expression. “Oh, darling, this is splendid! All this could be enough to hold out the year for us!” 
        <br><br>
        She was exaggerating. The girls were going through masks so quickly Ten is sure she’ll have today’s number doubled next month. Their obsession had been alarming at first, even to Ten who regularly switches masks between work and personal life. But now she was used to it. The girls gave her enough money for her to pay the rent for her grandparents’ old apartment. That’s enough incentive for Ten to continue acting her fox’s role. 
        <br><br>
        A soft tut behind her. “All these masks, Ten-darling, and you never think of switching that decrepit fox mask?” Thirteen’s eyes narrowed at her. “These are all so high-quality… Can’t possibly be discounted, right?” 
        <br><br>
        Ten knew what she was saying. You aren’t wearing the masks you sell because they’re shoddy or damaged. You gain more profit selling cheap products, and we all know you’re only here for the money. 
        <br><br>
        The only acceptable response would be to laugh it off. So Ten laid it on thick, throwing a dramatic, offended tone into her voice, which was easy since the accusation was, though not unfounded, untrue. Not this time, at least. “You can’t be serious, Thirteen? Why would I ever do that? I told you, I’m just old-fashioned. And the fox is… a gift.” 
        <br><br>
        Not a lie, not entirely. She’s not old-fashioned, but she had made a promise. And the fox… well, it is a gift from her grandparents, but she had never told anyone, and these girls weren’t about to be the first. 
        <br><br>
        None of these lies mattered, because no one will care about how her mother had opposed her mask-collecting phase in her teenage years, or how her grandparents, though the more traditional of the bunch, had secretly bought her the fox mask for her eighteenth birthday, had somehow snuck it into her room so that the first thing she saw waking up was that mask. 
        <br><br>
        But what mattered was that Ten really had tricked the girls before. Her first time here, she had thrown in a few second-hand masks from her company, even one of her own, but they were so rarely used they could barely be called second-hand. Thirteen was the one to notice a faded blemish on the pale temple of a winter jasmine mask, but Six had brushed it off as a manufacturing issue. Or it had bumped against the edges of the suitcase, not yet padded as it is now. 
        <br><br>
        Sweat gathered in Ten’s palms.
