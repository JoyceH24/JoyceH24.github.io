    7:30 <br>
    You wake, blinking blearily down at me. I light up at your attention. <br>
    You must like my smile today; you can not resist the urge to touch my cheek. <br>
    <br>
    7:42  <br>
    You’re clingy. As always. You can’t even spend a few minutes in the bathroom without me? <br>
    I watch you brush your teeth, but instead of your mirror you look at me. Like what you see? <br>
    You finger through the tangles of your hair; I think about how those curls would look with the gold hair clasp in your shopping cart online. <br>
    You ask me for my opinion on your outfit today. I’m good at giving you fashion advice and, as you like to say, charming you into buying unnecessary garments. You like it though, don’t you? <br>
    I tell you to choose the sundress, and buy a matching sun hat later. You say it’s as though I can read your mind. <br>
    I steal your first laugh of the day. It’s not as though this is a rare occurrence, but I’m still a little proud. <br>
    <br>
    8:04  <br>
    Breakfast. Avocado toast! The very one I’ve been bugging you about for the past week. I saw you drooling over it too last Friday. I know you want it. <br>
    Now hurry – you’re gonna be late if you don’t get out in ten minutes. <br>
    <br>
    8:17 <br>
    We’re ready. I trail you out the door, clad in the same coat as always – ever since you chose it for me two years ago, I’ve been wearing it dutifully. To show I’m yours. <br>
    It’s only a few steps down the stairs, but you still felt the urge to check that I’m with you. I know – the last incident had shaken you. You don’t want to lose me again. I still have scars down my chest. <br>
    <br>
    8:29  <br>
    It was a near thing. You were almost late! Thank goodness that kind lady held out the door for you. You retell the story to me – as though imprinting pieces of yourself onto me, to mark me as your own. <br>
    We say goodbye. Now it’s all dark for me. <br>
    <br>
    9:33 <br>
    You finally find time for me. It’s been an hour. <br>
    It’s a little exciting, isn’t it, stealing time right beneath your employer’s nose? I miss your cuddles. The intimacy between us. Your stifled giggles.<br> 
    <br>
    10:20 <br>
    Still dark. Do you remember that meeting? It was supposed to happen ten minutes ago. I hope you did. <br>
    <br>
    11:58 <br>
    You’re here again! You share your lunch with me. It’s beautifully arranged in the shape of a kitten. <br>
    Now you’re showing me your desktop arrangements. Your new pen. Your friend from the office next door. You tell me about the meeting you almost missed, because I wasn’t able to remind you. You regret leaving me behind. <br>
    You tell me about your entire morning at work: your coworker’s gossip, the annoying customer who doesn’t know a thing they’re talking about, how you snuck me into your office and we laughed together for half an hour. <br>
    But I was there. <br>
    You tell me about your entire day. You share your breakfast again. Your hairstyle, the one I helped you choose. The gold hair clasp you want to buy this afternoon. <br>
    You’re funny. Wasn’t I already there for all of this?  <br>
    It’s as though you’re determined to jam every piece of your life into me, as though that would mark me as yours. As though I would never leave you again if your stamp on me sinks deep enough. <br>
    Or perhaps – I’ve been thinking about this – you just need something, some record, to prove your existence. <br>
    I hope that's not all I am to you. <br>
    <br>
    13:40 <br>
    You find me again. A quick touch to the cheek. <br>
    Only when I see you is there light in this world. <br>
    <br>
    15:23 <br>
    You’re holding me a little too tight after another two hours apart. <br>
    Did you miss me so? <br>
    <br>
    17:12 <br>
    You say goodbye to your coworkers. I watch you smile with them and try not to feel jealous. <br>
    I offer a fancy restaurant for dinner tonight. Just the two of us. <br>
    <br>
    18:47 <br>
    We’re there. You’ve changed into a more fitted dress, at my suggestion. You ask me for recommendations; yet my lengthy explanations seem to bore you, and you just choose the most popular option instead. <br>
    You spend an excessive amount of time pushing the decorated dishes under my nose. Although I appreciate the view, I must say, this is a little too much. <br>
    You seem to enjoy the food though. Left a five-star review. <br>
    <br>
    20:16 <br>
    You’re home again. Face-mask, pajamas, pillows. Perfect combination. <br>
    <br>
    22:49 <br>
    You fell asleep. Missed a few calls. Lost a few hours. <br>
    Now I’m left forgotten by your side as you scramble to catch up with the emails and word docs you were supposed to have dealt with before dinner. <br>
    When I try to offer some comfort, a quick laugh, a way to relax, you turn away. Called me distracting. <br>
    <br>
    22:53 <br>
    Pushed me down the sofa. <br>
    <br>
    22:57 <br>
    I know you’re stressed. But I’m not something for you to take out your anger on. <br>
    <br>
    23:25 <br>
    You’re back. You’re you again. <br>
    I missed your hugs. Your soft hands, warm palm. Your gentle voice and the love in your eyes. <br>
    You could not afford to replace me. You promise to treat me better. <br>
    Your eyes, transfixed on mine, are a better promise than anything said out loud. <br>
    <br>
    23:58 <br>
    Your eyelids drooped from fatigue, yet you keep them fixed on me. Your fanatic worship is something I’ve always appreciated. <br>
    You hold me. Tight. <br>
    I remember all the nights, just you and me, side by side, light in the darkness. <br>
    I am the only one that will always be there for you. I am always by your side. <br>
    The tears you’ve shed under so many dejected moons, rolling across my own cheeks, is testament to that. <br>
    You keep a hand on my pulse. I keep an eye on your sleeping face. <br>
    <br>
    00:00  <br>
    A nightmare. You wake in cold sweat. <br>
    I am there for you – a light in the darkness. <br>
    You touch your finger to the pulse at the crook of my neck, my life and mortality compressed into a single pulsing swell. <br>
    You <a href="dark.html" class="no-underline">press</a> down, hard.  <br>
